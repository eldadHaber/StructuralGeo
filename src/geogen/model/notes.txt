Geomodel( 
    bounds=(0, 16) - can also be 3d tuple
    resolution=128 - can also be tuple for x,y,z
    dtype=np.float32
    name="model"
    height_tracking=True - height above and below, default is 3x
)

functions: 
    - _validate_model_params(self)
    - __repr__ - basic def to print(model)
    - __str__ - more detailed version of __repr__
    - _repr_html_
    - setup_mesh


Questions
- What is height_tracking? What is the normalize in z direction? why do we want to normalize heights?
- Explain strike, dip 
- Just curious - why save snapshots just with sedimentation and a transformation before?

Todo: look at events to understand how that works
